**READ THIS BEFORE USING THE APPLICATION**


This application is vulnerable! It is meant to be executed FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.
You are responsible for how you are using this application, and for what it does when it is attacked during an exploitation training session.

The application itself is trivial, it will NOT damage your system, nor install any additional components.
The application is not persistent, meaning that it will NOT start automatically at machine boot (unless you configure your system to do so).
You can read, study, and modify the provided code. If you modify the code, you are responsible for what it does (as always when you use this application).

IMPORTANT:
- BEST PRACTICE: Execute this application in a Virtual Machine with NO Internet access.
- DO NOT leave the application running unattended. Turn it off when your exploitation training session is over.

HOW YOU SHOULD USE THIS APPLICATION:
- Ethically and diligently develop your x64 exploits against it, have a good time and enjoy. I hope it can help anyone to learn!
- In this repository you can find one folder for each level, e.g. level-01, level-02, etc.
- Different levels cover different types of vulnerabilities / exploitation techniques.
- Levels are increasingly difficult, e.g. level-02 is more difficult than level-01, and so on.

HOW YOU SHOULD *NOT* USE THIS APPLICATION:
- You are NOT ALLOWED to store and/or run this application on any system that is not SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT EXPLOIT DEVELOPMENT TRAINING

Be ethical and enjoy exploit development.
